    Originality. Personal achievements. Self-sustaining independence. Renouncing emotions that would be hurdles in my pathway to my goals, dreams and desires. When sights are set; and the want, need, craving is there: nothing can make this aspiring mind and soul falter. This is I, Oliver Donnergren, twenty years of age - thirty years of experience.                                     </p>

    Starting life considered ordinary. My childhood was bright, lit-up and full of looming sunshine. Cared for and tucked into bed by a caring, hard-working and loving mother. Adolescence crawled its way from years ahead to the then present time and gradually transitioned the light into gloom. My outward-bound spirit became a hermit preferring reclusion. Years of experience transitioned into a metaphysical day cycle. One has truly not mastered survival if one cannot survive both the dark, mysterious nights and the bright, energetic days. The result: a boy - nay - a man which is strong both in willpower and knowledge. Today, a new day rises and with the experience and aptitude to seek further insight, the only limitation is where none can travel. Undiscovered roads will be found, I will find them before my legacy is passed onto the next generation of bright prodigious souls.

    Determination, endurance and the love for the craft, whether it be web development, photography or programming - heck, even something as seemingly plain as writing another story - be it poetry or a short tale is what keeps at it, day after day. Challenges, tackled head on is what motivates to evolve and wake up a more experienced man the morning after. Downtime: either momentary or prolonged is not spent resting. No sleep for the wicked after allâ€¦ - a hunt is initiated, a hunt for the next project that will be undertaken.

                <p>
    My story thus far is well documented, analysed and rehearsed. All chapters are there. Yet there is room in my book of life for more. Would you like write stories together? - You can! Interested in collaboratory work - perhaps introducing me to your team, or even offering a deal of some sort? Do not hesitate to <a href="contact.php">contact</a> me! Business or pleasure, whatever adds a paragraph to my book is appreciated. We will write new chapters together.

    Don't believe that - the truth is that a picture is worth much more than a mere word-count. Other properties often overlooked are interpretations, definitions and emotions. When setting the scene, adjusting the lens or tinging the canvas; great care and consideration is quintessential to produce poetry in picture-form that I am proud of, often blurring the lines between real and artificial motifs.

    Turtles sometimes cower too
    Confidence ceasing
    Fear of losing part of me
    Not my arm nor leg, but you
